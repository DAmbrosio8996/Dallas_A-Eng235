--> My name is Dallas Ambrosio. I am currently taking English 235 to go towards my Associate's degree in Computer Network Engineering. I currently work for the Steilacoom Historical School District as an IT Technician. I already work with many documents that technical writers have written, but I also translate the jargon that my coworkers cannot convert into "normal" speech. When I close work orders, I am doing a bit of technical writing myself; I describe what I've done with the work, and how I've solved it.
--> My initial understanding of Technical Writing is when legal documents and other formal paperwork are written in a proper manner. This did not exactly match up with the readings as the readings explained that they are mainly "translating" certain texts into wording that other people can understand. These include instructions, poems, legal documants and other things. So, yes, they write important documents, but no, they do not do just legal documents.
