Research Log

-----------------------------------------------------Week 1-----------------------------------------------------

--> My name is Dallas Ambrosio. I am currently taking English 235 to go towards my Associate's degree in Computer Network Engineering. I currently work for the Steilacoom Historical School District as an IT Technician. I already work with many documents that technical writers have written, but I also translate the jargon that my coworkers cannot convert into "normal" speech. When I close work orders, I am doing a bit of technical writing myself; I describe what I've done with the work, and how I've solved it.
--> My initial understanding of Technical Writing is when legal documents and other formal paperwork are written in a proper manner. This did not exactly match up with the readings as the readings explained that they are mainly "translating" certain texts into wording that other people can understand. These include instructions, poems, legal documants and other things. So, yes, they write important documents, but no, they do not do just legal documents.
--> When setting up GitHub, I noticed that it is an advanced file system that is not just a file system. Each repository has a Master branch and require a README file. The editor is definitely made for programmers using code. Putting all the research logs into one file is going to be interesting.
--> Programming Historian seems to be geared more towards people looking for information on what certain things are like programming, etc. Pierce Hacker looks like it will be more for students around campus who need a guide on something, or for the technical writers to add something.
