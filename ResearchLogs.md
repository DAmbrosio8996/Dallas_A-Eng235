Research Log


-----------------------------------------------------------------Week 1-----------------------------------------------------------------


--> My name is Dallas Ambrosio. I am currently taking English 235 to go towards my Associate's degree in Computer Network Engineering. I currently work for the Steilacoom Historical School District as an IT Technician. I already work with many documents that technical writers have written, but I also translate the jargon that my coworkers cannot convert into "normal" speech. When I close work orders, I am doing a bit of technical writing myself; I describe what I've done with the work, and how I've solved it.

--> My initial understanding of Technical Writing is when legal documents and other formal paperwork are written in a proper manner. This did not exactly match up with the readings as the readings explained that they are mainly "translating" certain texts into wording that other people can understand. These include instructions, poems, legal documants and other things. So, yes, they write important documents, but no, they do not do just legal documents.

--> When setting up GitHub, I noticed that it is an advanced file system that is not just a file system. Each repository has a Master branch and require a README file. The editor is definitely made for programmers using code. Putting all the research logs into one file is going to be interesting.

--> Programming Historian seems to be geared more towards people looking for information on what certain things are like programming, etc. Pierce Hacker looks like it will be more for students around campus who need a guide on something, or for the technical writers to add something. Programming Historian looks like its purpose is to provide information to those that seek knowledge on programming. Pierce Hacker's purpose is to provide the student body with information that may be local to them. The designers probably put their project up on public websites to help people. They think their information can help someone learn something.

--> This week I've learned that technical writing is more than just legal paperwork and documentation. It is more of like an act of translating forms of text into text other people can understand and follow. I was also able to learn how to use GitHub at a basic level; creating an account, creating a directory and branches, and how to add files into those directories. It is an overall interesting first week of class.

--> During the creation of the instruction sets, a lot of choices were made. My initial thought for making a structure was to make it not too complicated. I choose pieces that were not very elaborate and kept the build. I wanted to make instructions that were similar to real Lego instructions, so I designed my set around that too. The document itself was very time-consuming as uploading pictures into it and editing their size and position took hours. I never realized how hard it was to describe how to attach two lego pieces together. It did eventually get done, and it looked pretty neat.

--> My sense of the audience is the "average joe". No one like complicated or confusing instructions. I designed my whole instuction set around making it simple for many people to do. The easiest thing to follow is clear pictures. When people get new legos, they usually get an instruction set with it, and I wanted to keep that familiar feeling in people.

--> My instructions were printed on physical paper. Once again, I wanted a feeling similar to actual lego manuals. So, I designed a layout for the pictures that would fit on a regular 8.5x11" piece of paper. I feel pretty good as a writer for choosing to print out my instruction set. I feel that it made me choose my words carefully so that it would match up with the pictures I put on the paper.

--> All in all, I feel like I learned how to organize technical writing into a neat document. I had to space out my thoughts and turn them into steps. I then had to properly place those thoughts onto a document so that it would fit and look okay. I learned some formatting by doing the instruction sets, but also by reading markdown tutorials on some Github formatting stuff.



-----------------------------------------------------------------Week 3-----------------------------------------------------------------


--> This week we attempted to compose a survey to send out to Pierce college that will get information on student's understanding of technology. One challenge in this project was that we needed to form questions that would get specific answers from the survey taker. They also had to be multiple choice. Collaboration was very hard for me this time around because of conflicting ideals between each other. I was trying to lead discussion in one way while others were trying to lead them in their ways. It's interesting to review each question in the process as we have to think if the question really fits what we're looking for. When working on this project, the sense of audience I got was to make it simple for them. The audience wants it to be short, easy to read, and have pre-determined choices.

--> I now see that the audience for Pierce Hacker is mostly towards students that attend Pierce College. The purpose is to provide the audience with information and tutorials on various technologies used in classes that students may want or need more understanding of. I believe using a public website as the medium for the project made it so that anyone can access it from anywhere. If Pierce Hacker is the only tutorial on a certain technology, then anyone can find it if searching the interent correctly. It should not be limited to just Pierce College students and staff.

--> This week I learned some proper technical writing etiquette and grammar through forming questions for the survey. I was also exposed to another way that a technical writing process is done. We got into groups, brainstormed, revised, and discussed some more. I met some of the learning outcomes that were described. I did not expect to not like working in a group so much. I feel like I could have accomplished more personal outcomes if I was able to do a part by myself.



-----------------------------------------------------------------Week 4-----------------------------------------------------------------


--> I had found a video tutorial on research reports and to me that is easier to understand. Sometimes it's easier to understand someone explaining a concept to you rather that just reading it. Someone had already posted that. So, I found a different guide that is not a video, but it has a nice basic outline for analytical reports. It also goes over the focus on audiences. The link can be found here. http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~brian/701/notes/paper-structure.pdf

--> This week I learned that cleaning up questions on a survey can be a lot of work. It did count towards the goal of learning the process of technical writing though. I also learned even more neutral language that fits proper formatting and wording goals in the class. It was a short week in class, so it was hard for me to finish any work that would be outside of class, but I will keep working hard towards the class and personal outcomes.
